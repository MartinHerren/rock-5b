Subject: [PATCH 01/72] irqchip/gic-v3: Enable Rockchip 3588001 erratum
 workaround for RK3588S

Commit a8707f553884 ("irqchip/gic-v3: Add Rockchip 3588001 erratum
workaround") mentioned RK3588S (the slimmed down variant of RK3588)
being affected, but did not check for its compatible value. Thus the
quirk is not applied on RK3588S. Since the GIC ITS node got added to the
upstream DT, boards using RK3588S are no longer booting without this
quirk being applied.

Fixes: 06cdac8e8407 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: add GIC ITS support to rk3588")
